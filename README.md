# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to make an interactive and dynamic webpage that contains recorded UFO sightings in the United States. We'll display filters so that users can search by date, city, county, country, and shape. 

## Results

As we've made our webpage user-friendly, visitors will be able to easily navigate through it by using the filters option on the left side of the webpage. Below is an overview of what the webpage looks like.

The data is displayed on the right-hand side but instead if sifting through the results, users can type in criteria to assist in their search. If a user is interested in a specific date, they can type the month, day, and year as shown below for the date 1/12/2010:

#### City Filter
Let's say the user doesn't have a date but wants to search a specific city. We used Wichita as an example below:

#### Shape Filter 

We've also added filters for county, country, and even shape as shown below:

## Summary

Overall, our webpage provides users with a simple way to find the results of the UFO sightings they are searching for. One drawback of this design is the formatting - what users type has to follow that of what you see in the default search, so it has to be in all lowercase. For further development, I recommend having the formatting for filters be adaptable to both lower and upper case so "ca" and "CA" is picked up by the program as the same thing. I also recommend having a drop down menu to all the filters so that users don't have to type if they don't want to - they can scroll and find all the options available to them.
